# dse_static_cookiecutter_interns

Test repo to keep an overview of what's going on with testing dse-static

I created this so you can try out the https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/dse-static-cookiecutter

**If you want to, try the following:**

I don't mind if you work in this repo (you could eg. also create branches) or if you [create your own repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/quickstart-for-repositories). But keep in mind that working together in one repo might complicate the work.

Also remember that our repositories should/will be public, so don't commit any sensible data!!

Follow the quick-start guide at https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/dse-static-cookiecutter setting up a basic installation with example data.
Play around with it:

- Try to process some of your own basic (textual) data there, using a github workflow and the existing xslt. (You would need to create/provide some valid TEI-XML first! such as:https://github.com/Auden-Musulin-Papers/amp-data/tree/main/data/editions; the edition is mostly in English, if you have created your own pilot TEI/XML feel free to use these)
- Try to publish the result using github pages.
- Maybe try do display some spatial data?
  - Try utilizing existing js-code ( https://github.com/ofmgraz/ofm-static/blob/main/html/js/make_map_and_table.js
    and https://github.com/ofmgraz/ofm-static/blob/main/html/js/map_table_cfg.js ),
  - This repository show how to create basic functionality: https://ofmgraz.github.io/ofm-static/listplace.html

What you will need:

1. basic python
2. basic bash
3. xslt
4. git
5. github account
6. maybe js
